# AIRLINES-FATALITIES-ANALYSIS
This dashboard is an analysis of Airline fatalities between 1908-2009

----
# Project Objective: Problem Statement
This analysis is aimed at understanding trends of airline fatalities in the period of review, the airplanes that have suffered the most fatalities, the number of passengers that board airplanes yearly and the locations that have suffered airline fatalities.

# Data Sourcing:
Data is sourced from 30DaysofLearningUsingPowerBi, a repository created by Olanrewaju Oyinbooke. ![Airlines fatalities data sourcing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107516898/201764631-99139a5b-4c35-4970-8599-4f6ff8bf16ce.png)

# Data Transformation:
After sourcing the data from the repository, i then loaded power BI for transformation via a tool called Power Query where some basic data cleanin techniques were applied as seen in the image below:

# Creating Relationships:
After transforming the data, i then loaded it into Power Bi for analysis. In the course of analysis, i had to create a "calendar table" for my date and hence, created a relationship between the Calendar Table and the date column in the fact table. We can see that in the image below:

# Findings: A number of observations were noted in the course of analysis which entails the following:
- Sum of fatalities in the period of review stood at 37k
- Total number of passengers that were on airplanes in the period of review stood at 47k
- Tenerife, Canary Island was the location that suffered the most fatalities. 
- The "Douglas DC-3" airplane accounted for the most fatalities (2000).



----
# Recommendations: 
- Given that the Douglas DC-3 airplane that recorded the most casualties was a military airplane, chances are that it occurred during a conflict period. It is therefore necessary for peace to be sustained amongst nations to prevent anymore wars.
- Some other causes of airplane crashes/fatalities include bad waether, engine failure, and insufficient fuel, which makes it important that due diligence be carried out before any flight is approved.
